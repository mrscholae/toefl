        <p>Question 1- 10 </p>
        <p>The conservatism of the early English colonists in North America, their strong <b>(1) attachment to</b> the English way of doing things, would play a major part in the furniture that was made in New England. The very tools that the first New England furniture makers used were, after all, not much different from those used for centuries – even millennia: basic hammers, saws, chisels, planes, augers, compasses, and measures. These were the tools used more or less by all people who worked with wood: carpenters, barrel makers, and shipwrights. At most the furniture makers might have had planes with special edges or more delicate chisels, but there could not have been much specialization in the early years of the colonies.</p>
        <p>The furniture makers in those early decades of the 1600’ s were known as “joiners,” for the primary method of constructing furniture, at least among the English of this   time, was that of mortise-and-tenon joinery. The mortise is the hole chiseled and cut into one piece of wood, while the tenon is the tongue or <b>(2) protruding</b> element shaped from another piece of wood so that it fits into the mortise; and another small hole is then drilled (with the auger) through the mortised end and the tenon so that a whittled peg can secure the joint – thus the term “joiner.” Panels were fitted into slots on the basic frames. This kind of construction was used for making everything from houses to chests. </p>
        <p>Relatively little hardware was used during this period. Some nails – forged by hand – were used, but no screws or glue. Hinges were often made of leather, but metal hinges were also used. The cruder varieties were made by blacksmiths in the colonies, but the finer metal elements were imported. Locks and escutcheon plates – the latter to <b>(7) shield</b> the wood from the metal key – would often be imported. </p>
        <p>Above all, what the early English colonists imported was their knowledge of, familiarity with, and dedication to the traditional types and designs of furniture <b>(8) they</b> knew in England.</p>"

        <p>Question 11 – 20 </p>
        <p>In addition to their military role, the forts of the nineteenth century provided numerous other benefits for the American West. The establishment of these posts opened new roads and provided for the protection of <b>(12) daring</b> adventurers and expeditions as well as established settlers. Forts also served as bases where enterprising entrepreneurs could bring commerce to the West, providing supplies and refreshments to soldiers as well as to pioneers. Posts like Fort Laramie provided supplies for wagon trains traveling the     natural highways toward new frontiers. Some posts became stations for the pony express; still <b>(14) others</b>, such as Fort Davis, were stagecoach stops for weary travelers. All    of these functions, of course, suggest that the contributions of the forts to the civilization and development of the West extended beyond patrol duty.</p>
        <p>Through the establishment of military posts, yet other contributions were made to the development of western culture. Many posts maintained libraries or reading rooms, and some – for example, Fort Davis – had schools. Post chapels provided a setting for religious services and weddings. Throughout the wilderness, post bands provided entertainment and <b>(15) boosted</b> morale. During the last part of the nineteenth century, to reduce expenses, gardening was encouraged at the forts, thus making experimental  agriculture another activity of the military. The military stationed at the various forts also played a role in civilian life by assisting in maintaining order, and civilian officials often called on the army for protection.</p>
        <p>Certainly, among other significant contributions the army made to the improvement of the conditions of life was the investigation of the relationships among health, climate, and architecture. From the earliest colonial times throughout the nineteenth century, disease ranked as the foremost problem in defense. It slowed construction of forts and <b>(18) inhibited</b> their military functions. Official documents from many regions contained innumerable reports of sickness that virtually incapacitated entire garrisons. In response to the problems, detailed observations of architecture and climate and their relationships to the frequency of the occurrence of various diseases were recorded at various posts across the nation by military surgeons.</p>"

        <p>Question 21 – 30 </p>
        <p>Anyone who has handled a fossilized bone knows that it is usually not exactly like its modern <b>(22) counterpart</b>, the most obvious difference being that it is often much heavier. Fossils often have the quality of stone rather than of organic materials, and this has led to the use of the term “petrifaction” (to bring about rock). The implication is that bone, and other tissues, have somehow been turned into stone, and this is certainly the explanation given in some texts. But it is wrong interpretation; fossils are frequently so dense because the <b>(24) pores</b> and other spaces in the bone have become filled with minerals taken up from the surrounding sediments. Some fossil bones have all the interstitial spaces filled with foreign minerals, including the marrow cavity, if there is one, while others have taken up but little from their surroundings. Probably all of the minerals deposited within the bone have been recrystallized from solution by the action of water percolating thru them. The degree of mineralization appears to be determined by the nature of the environment in which the bone was deposited and not by the antiquity of the bone. For example, the black fossil bones that are so common in many parts of Florida are heavily mineralized, but they are only about 20,000 years old, whereas many of the dinosaur bones from western Canada, which are about 75 million years old, are only partially filled in. Under optimum conditions the process of mineralization probably takes thousands rather than millions of years, perhaps considerably less. </p>
        <p>The amount of change that has occurred in fossil bone, even in bone as old as that of dinosaurs, is often remarkably small. We are therefore usually able to see the microscopic structures of the bone, including such fine details as the lacunae where the living bone cells once resided. The natural bone mineral, the hydroxyapatite, is virtually unaltered too – <b>(28) it</b> has the same crystal structure as that of modern bone. Although nothing remains of the original collagen, some of its component amino acids   are usually still <b>(29) detectable</b>, together with amino acids of the noncollagen proteins of bone.</p>"

        <p>Question 31 – 40 </p>
        <p>In the last third of the nineteenth century a new housing form was quietly being developed. In 1869 the Stuyvesant, considered New York’ s first apartment house was   built on East Eighteenth Street. The building was financed by the developer Rutherfurd Line Stuyvesant and designed by Richard Morris Hunt, the first American architect to graduate from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Each man had lived in Paris, and each understood the economics and social potential of this Parisian housing form. But the Stuyvesant was at best a limited success. In spite of Hunt’ s <b>(32) inviting</b> façade, the living space was awkwardly arranged. Those who could afford them were quite content to remain in the more <b>(34) sumptuous</b>, single-family homes, leaving the Stuyvesant to young married couples and bachelors. </p>
        <p>The fundamental problem with the Stuyvesant and the other early apartment buildings that quickly followed, in the 1870’ s and early 1880’ s was that they were confined to the typical New York building lot. That lot was a rectangular area 25 feet wide by 100   feet deep – a shape perfectly suited for a row house. The lot could also accommodate a rectangular tenement, though it could not <b>(38) yield</b> the square, well-lighted, and logically arranged rooms that great apartment buildings require. But even with the awkward interior configurations of the early apartment buildings, the idea caught on. It met the needs of a large and growing population that wanted something better than tenements but could not afford or did not want row houses.</p>
        <p>So while the city’ s newly emerging social leadership commissioned their mansions,apartment houses and hotels began to sprout in multiple lots, thus breaking the initial space constraints. In the closing decades of the nineteenth century, large apartment houses began dotting the developed portions of New York City, and by the opening decades of the twentieth century, spacious buildings, such as the Dakota and the Ansonia finally transcended the tight confinement of row house building lots. From there it was only a small step to building luxury apartment houses on the newly created Park Avenue right next to the fashionable Fifth Avenue shopping area.</p>"

        <p>Question 41 – 50 </p>
        <p>A snowfall consists of myriads of <b>(42) minute</b> ice crystals that fall to the ground in the form of frozen precipitation. The formation of snow begins with these ice crystals in the subfreezing strata of the middle and upper atmosphere when there is an adequate supply of moisture present. At the core of every ice crystal is a minuscule nucleus, a solid particle of matter around which moisture condenses and freezes. Liquid water droplets floating in the supercooled atmosphere and free ice crystals cannot coexist within the same cloud, since the vapor pressure of ice is less than that of water. This enables the ice crystals to rob the liquid droplets of their moisture and grow continuously. The process can be very rapid, quickly creating sizable ice crystals, some of which <b>(44) adhere</b> to each other to create a cluster of ice crystals or a snowflake. Simple flakes possess a variety of beautiful forms, usually hexagonal, though the symmetrical shapes reproduced in most microscope photography of snowflakes are not usually found in actual snowfalls. Typically, snowflakes in actual snowfall consists of broken fragments and clusters of adhering ice crystals.</p>
        <p>For a snowfall to continue once <b>(46) it</b> starts, there must be a constant inflow of moisture to supply the nuclei. This moisture is supplied by the passage of an airstream over a water surface and its subsequent lifting to higher regions of the atmosphere. The Pacific Ocean is the source of moisture for most snowfalls west of the Rocky Mountains, while the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean feed water vapor into the air currents over the central and eastern sections of the United States. Other geographical features also can be the source of moisture for some snowstorms. For example, areas adjacent to the Great Lakes experience their own unique lake-effect storms, employing a variation of the process on a local scale. In addition, mountainous section or rising terrain can <b>(49) initiate</b> snowfalls by the geographical lifting of a moist airstream.</p>"

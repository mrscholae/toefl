        <p><i><b>Questions 1 through 10 are based on the following reading passage.</b></i></p>
        <p>Elizhabeth Blackwell was born in England in 1821 and emigrated to New York City when she was ten years old. One day she decided that she wanted to become a doctor. That was nearly impossible for a woman in the midle of the ninteenth century. After writing many letters seeking admission to medical schools, she was finally accepted by a doctor in Philadelpia, so determined was she that she taught school and gave music lessons to earn money for her tuition.</p>
        <p>In 1849, after graduation from medical school, she decided to further her education in Paris. She wanted to be a surgeon, but a serious eye infection forced her to <b>abandon</b> the idea.</p>
        <p>Upon returning to the united states, she found it difficult to start her own practice becasue she was a woman. By 1857, Elizhabet and her sister also a doctor, along with another female doctor, managed to open a new horpital, the first for women and children. Besides being the first female physician in the United States and founding her own hospital, she also established the first medical school for woman.</p>

        <p><i><b>Question 11 through 21 are based on the following passage</b></i></p>
        <p>Glands manufacture and secrete necessary substances. Exocrine glands secrete their products trough ducts, but endocrine glands, or ductless glands, release their products directly into the bloodstream.</p>
        <p>One important endocrine glands is the thyroid gland. It is in the neck and has two lobes, one one each side of the windpipe. The thyroid gland collects iodine from the blood and produces thyroxine, an important hormone, which it stores in an inactive form. When thyroxine is needed by the body, the thyroid gland secretes it directly into the bloodstream. Thyroxine is combined int the body cells with other chemicals and effects many functions of the body.</p>
        <p>The thyroid gland may be underactive or overactive, resulting in problem. An underactive thyroid causes hypothyroidism, while an overactive one causes Hyperthyroidism. The former problem, called myxedema in adults and cretinism in children, causes the growth process to slow down. A cretin's body and mind do not grow to their full potential. Hyperthyroidism, on the other hand, results in extreme nervousness, an increase in heart action, and other problems.</p>
        <p>Either  hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may result in goither, or an enlarged thyroid gland. A goiter will appear when the body is not getting enough iodine. Goiter is less common today, since most people use iodized salt.</p>
        <p>Kieven Russia also enjoyed a century of rebirth some two hundred years later under the able rule of yaroslav the Wise. Like Charlemagne, he founded schools, established libraries, and brought about many architectural achievements.</p>

        <p><b><i>Question 22 through 30 are based on the following passage</i></b></p>
        <p>A recent investigation by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey shows that strange animal behavior might help predict earthquakes. Investigators found such occurrences within a ten-kilometer radius of the epicenter of a fairly recent quake. Some birds screeched and flew about wildly; dogs yelped and ran around uncontrollably.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe that animals can perceive environmental changes several hours or even days before the mishap. Animals were noted as being restles for several weeks before a Tashkent, Uzbekistan, earthquake. An hour before the disaster, domestic animals refused to go indoors , and dogs howled and barked furiously. In 1960, an earthquake struck Agadir in Morocco. Survivors recall that stray animals, including dogs, were seen streaming out of town before the earthquake. In a safari zoo near San Francisco, Ilamas would not eat the evening before a 1979 quake, and they ran around wildly all night.</p>
        <p>Unusual animal behavior preceding earthquakes has been noted for centuries. British Admiral Robert Fitzroy  reported huge flocks of screaming seabirds over Concepcion, Chile, in 1835. An hour and a half later, dogs were seen fleeing , and ten minutes later the town was destroyed. Similar stories of chickens running around in apparent states of panic, horses trembling, and dogs barking incessantly were recorded throughout the eighteenth and nine-teenth centuries by survivors of earthquake destruction in India, Yugoslavia, Peru, Mexico, and the United States.</p>
        <p>In 1976, after monitoring bizzare animal behavior, the Chinese predicted a devastating earthquake. Although hundreds of thousands of people were killed, the government was able to evacuate millions of other people and thus keep the death toll at a lower level.</p>

        <p><i><b>Questions 31 through 39 are based on the following passage.</b></i></p>
        <p>As far back as 700 B.C., people have talked about children being cared for by wolves. Romulus and Remus, the legendary twin founders of Rome, were purported to have been cared for by wolves. According to legend, Mars fathered the two boys. As a result, a relative of their mother imprisoned her and ordered that the boys be drowned in the Tiber River. However, a she-wolf saved them from this horrible fate and took them back to her lair to care for them. Legend has it that when a she-wolf loses her litter, she seeks a human child to take its place.</p>
        <p>This seemingly preposterous idea did not become credible until the late nineteenth century when a French doctor actually found a naked ten-year-old boy wandering in the woods. He did not walk erect, could not speak intelligibly, nor could he relate to people. He only growled and stared at them. Finally, the doctor won the boy's confidence and began to work with him. After many long years of devoted and patient instruction, the doctor was able to get the boy to clothe and feed himself, recognize and utter a number of words, and write letters and form words.</p>

        <p><i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> is a bacterial organism that has been isolated from sea water, shellfish, finfish, plankton, and salt springs. It has been a major cause of food poisoning in Japan, compelling the Japanese to do several studies on it. They have confirmed the presence of V. Parahaemolyticus in the north and central Pacific, with the highest abundance in inshore waters, particularly in or near large harbors.</p>
        <p>A man named Nishio studied the relationship between the chloride content of sea water and the seasonal distribution of <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>  and concluded that while the isolation of the organism was independent of the sodium chloride content, the distribution of the bacteria in sea water was dependent on the water temperature. In fact, it has been isolated in high frequencies during summer, from June to September, but was not isolated with the same frequency in winter.</p>
        <p>Within four or five days after eating contaminated foods, a person will begin to experience diarrhea, the most common symptom; this will very often be accompanied by stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Headache and fever, with or without chills, may also be experienced.</p>
